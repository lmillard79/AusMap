## Adding Map Layers

Once installed, the AusMap plugin appears in the QGIS menu bar.

The available map layers are arranged in alphabetically ordered categories.

## Search Functionality

You can search for the layers in AusMap by using the locator bar in the bottom left corner of the QGIS interface. Double-clicking on a layer in the search results will add it to the map canvas.
